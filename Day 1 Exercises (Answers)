Exercises

    1. When you look at the object file, you see many unusual characters and other gibberish. Mixed in with the gibberish, you also see pieces of the source file.

    2. This program calculates the area of a circle. It prompts the user for the radius and then displays the area.

    3. This program prints a 10*10 block made of the character X. A similar program is covered on Day 6, "Basic Program Control."

    4. This program generates a compiler error. You should get a message similar to the following:

    Error: ch1ex4.c: Declaration terminated incorrectly

    This error is caused by the semicolon at the end of line 3. If you remove the semicolon, this program should compile and link correctly.

    5. This program compiles OK, but it generates a linker error. You should get a message similar to the following:

    Error: Undefined symbol _do_it in module...

    This error occurs because the linker can't find a function called do_it. To fix this program, change do_it to printf.

    6. Rather than printing a 10*10 block filled with the character X, the program now prints a 10*10 block of smiley faces.
