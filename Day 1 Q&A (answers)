1. C is powerful, popular, and portable.
2. The compiler translates C source code into machine-language instructions that your computer can understand.
3. Editing, compiling, linking, and testing.
4. The answer to this question depends on your compiler. Consult your compiler’s manuals.
5. The answer to this question depends on your compiler. Consult your compiler’s manuals.
6. The appropriate extension for C source files is .C (or .c).
Note: C++ uses the extension .CPP. You can write and compile your C programs
with a .CPP extension, but it’s more appropriate to use a .C extension.
7. FILENAME.TXT would compile. However, it’s more appropriate to use a .C extension rather than .TXT.
8. You should make changes to the source code to correct the problems. You should then recompile and relink. After relinking, you should run the program again to see whether your corrections fixed the program.
9. Machine language is made up of digital or binary instructions that the computer can understand. Because the computer can’t understand C source code, a compiler translates source code to machine code, also called object code.
10. The linker combines the object code from your program with the object code from the function library and creates an executable file.
